### About Me

I am a M.S. graduate student in the Biostatistics Department at Columbia University. In my previous life on the west coast (best coast), I worked on IVD clinical trials for blood donation screening. I am passionate about the role of infectious disease surveillance in the clinical realm, whether it's assessing the safety of novel viral therapeutics or monitoring blood products for emerging infectious agents. 

In my free time, you can find me chasing waterfalls and alpine meadows.
