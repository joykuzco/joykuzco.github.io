### About Me

Hello! I am an M.S. Candidate in the Biostatistics Department at Columbia University. 

In the past 4 years, I worked in the clinical research field for drug and medical device development. Most recently, I worked on IVD clinical trials for blood donation screening, on NAT platforms. In my career, I plan to leverage data science to meet challenges in disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapeutics. Particularly, I am interested in clinical trial designs that focus on representation of minority groups and subpopulations. 

In my free time, you can find me chasing waterfalls and alpine meadows.

As a recent Vancouver/San Diego transplant preparing to weather my first East Coast winter, I have sketched [a few figures](pg_flexdashboard.html) on New York weather trends. Hopefully, this will help you plot your winter wardrobe too.
